# Arduino Valorant Aimbot
I have created and developed an external cheat program for Valorant using Arduino and Python programs that detect colors, then send signals to the Arduino to move the mouse. However, I realized that my knowledge of spoofing is limited, which allows Vanguard to detect this program. Therefore, I feel that now is the right time to end this project and switch my focus to developing my other skills.
